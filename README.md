# nowhere-status
This project started out of boredom. As most programming projects do.
A simple status bar command I use for sway. It's mildly broken but it's a neat project

## Build instructions
In the base directory of the repository just run
```bash
$> make
```

## Usage
```bash
$> ./build/nowhere-status --offline --thermal 2 --ifname wlp9s0
```
